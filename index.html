<h1>Machine Learning the NBA MVP Race</h1>
<p>The NBA MVP is selected every year to determine who the "Most Valuable Player"
during the regular season's 82 games is. The decision is made using a voting system,
where a group of people cast votes to decide who will win the award.</p>

<p>Since the voter data is made public, we can find out voting information for a
particular season such as <b>First Place Votes</b>, <b>Points Won</b> and <b>Share</b>.
Ideally, we could use some of this data as an output to train a regression model on,
such that our model can predict the votes each player in the MVP race gets for a given season and thus, 
who will become that season's league MVP.</p>

<p>This data is available on <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com">Basketball Reference</a>
for every season since the award's existence (as well as additional player and team data).
I scraped the data using <a href="https://github.com/ybrenning/hoopy">hooPY</a>, a simple Python CLI tool
I wrote for accessing NBA data from basketball reference.</p>

<p>I retrieved MVP data from the past 30 years as well as advanced stats, which I plan on using
as feature data to train the model.</p>
