# MVP Race

This is a simple project demonstrating a use case of my [NBA scraping tool](https://github.com/ybrenning/hoopy).

I decided to try and predict NBA MVPs based on the stats scraped from Basketball Reference and documented the results in a short static web page.

Furthermore, the notebook contains the data preparation and model training.
